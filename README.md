## Project 0 for Project Nautilus ##

###Instructions:

0. index.html is an HTML file, which is a document that will be displayed as a website. Open it up in a text editor like Sublime Text to edit it, or open it in a browser like Google Chrome to see how it looks!
1. Add your name where it says [Your name]. Refresh to see it! Answer the other questions in the HTML by changing and saving the text in the file. Watch what happens when you refresh the page!
2. Notice how the site is boring and isn't styled? That's because there's no CSS, which controls the style of the page. Go to the forums to get instructions for creating a <link> to the CSS in the file styles.css.
3. Looks better, but now see how the profile picture is just too big for the page? There's a bug in your CSS. Contact your mentor to get some help!
4. Now that you have the styles for the page, customize some colors! Go into styles.css and change the color of the colored bar in the middle of the screen.
5. What did you say for the last question? Hop on chat and share your answer with your group! See any common answers?
